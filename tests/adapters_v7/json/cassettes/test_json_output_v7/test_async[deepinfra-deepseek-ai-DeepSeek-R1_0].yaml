        the user wants a simple JSON output. Let me think about what to include. They
        didn''t specify any particular data, so maybe a basic example. Common examples
        are user info or a simple structure. Let me choose something with a few key-value
        pairs. Maybe a person with name, age, and city. That''s straightforward. Make
        sure the syntax is correct: curly braces, quotes around keys, proper commas.
        Check for any errors. Yeah, that should work. Here''s the JSON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\":
