        Certainly! Below is an example of a simple JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
        object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Doe\",\n  \"age\":
        30,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\n    \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n    \"zipCode\":
        \"12345\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\":
        \"212-555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"office\",\n      \"number\":
        \"646-555-4567\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isActive\": true\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object
        represents a person with some basic attributes. It includes a nested object
        for the address and an array of phone numbers, each with its own type and
        number. The `isActive` field is a boolean indicating whether the person is
        active or not. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy
        for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":283,"completion_tokens":271,"estimated_cost":0.00014150000000000002}}'
