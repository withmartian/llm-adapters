        the user wants a simple JSON. Let me think about what that means. They probably
        want a basic example without any complex structures. Maybe something with
        a few key-value pairs. Let me start with a basic structure.\n\nI should include
        some common keys like \"name\", \"age\", maybe a boolean like \"isStudent\",
        and an array for \"hobbies\". That should cover the basics. Let me check the
        syntax to make sure there are no errors. Keys in quotes, proper commas, and
        the right brackets. Yeah, that looks good. Let me present it clearly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":
