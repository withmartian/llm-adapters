        a number between 1 and 100, and you can try to guess it. I'll tell you if
        your guess is too high or too low. How about it?\\n\\n2. **Fun Fact**: Did
        you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? It takes Venus
        about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around
        225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun.\\n\\nIf you're not in the mood
