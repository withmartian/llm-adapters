        How can I help you today?\n\nI''m here to answer questions about technology,
        coding, and related topics. Let me know what''s on your mind and I''ll do
        my best to assist you.\n\n(If you''re looking for technical support or have
        a specific question, just let me know and I''ll do my best to help.)\n\nTo
        get started, here are a few tips for using this chat interface:\n\n* To send
        a message, just type it in the text box at the bottom of the screen and hit
        enter.\n* To format your text, you can use markdown syntax. For example, to
        make text bold, surround it with asterisks (e.g. `*like this*`), or to create
        a link, surround the text with square brackets and follow it with the URL
        in parentheses (e.g. `[link text](http://example.com)`).\n* If you want to
        include code in your message, you can use triple backticks (```) to create
        a code block. For example:\n\n```\n```\ndef hello_world():\n  print(\"Hello,
        world!\")\n```\n\n```\n\nThis will format the text as a code block, with syntax
        highlighting for a variety of languages.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions
        about how to use these features. I''m here to help!","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"total_tokens":318,"completion_tokens":307,"estimated_cost":7.632e-05}}'
