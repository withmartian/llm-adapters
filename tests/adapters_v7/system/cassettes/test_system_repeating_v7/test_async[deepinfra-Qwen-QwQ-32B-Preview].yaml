        so I'm trying to figure out what the user is asking here. They sent a bunch

        probably respond in a friendly way. They might be looking for a conversation
        starter or just checking how I handle repeated messages. I'll make sure to
        keep it welcoming and see where they lead the conversation next.\\n</think>\\n\\nHello!
