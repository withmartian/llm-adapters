        so I''m trying to figure out what the user is asking for here. They just sent
        a bunch of \"Hi\" messages and then some empty quotes. Maybe they''re testing
        something or just being playful. I responded with \"Hi\" and an emoji, but
        they sent a bunch of empty quotes again. Hmm, maybe they want me to say \"Hi\"
        back each time or perhaps they''re trying to see how I handle multiple messages.\n</think>\n\nHi!
        It looks like you''re sending multiple \"Hi\" messages. How can I assist you
