        so the user has sent a message that consists of multiple \"Hi\"s and then
        an empty string. I''m trying to figure out what they want. It''s possible
        they''re just greeting me, but sometimes people use repeated greetings to
        signal something else, like testing the bot or maybe they''re looking for
        a conversation starter.\n\nI should consider that maybe they''re not sure
        how to start a proper conversation, so they just keep saying \"Hi.\" Or perhaps
        they''re trying to see how I respond to repeated messages. Either way, my
        goal is to be helpful and encouraging.\n\nI should respond in a friendly manner,
        acknowledge their message, and perhaps offer assistance or ask how I can help
        them today. That way, it opens the door for them to share more if they want
        to. I want to make sure my response is welcoming and encourages further interaction
        without being overwhelming.\n\nAlso, since they ended with an empty string,
        maybe they hesitated or changed their mind mid-message. I should be patient
        and not assume anything negative. Just keep the conversation open and positive.\n\nIn
        summary, I''ll respond with a friendly greeting, acknowledge their message,
        and offer my assistance to see how I can help them today. That should cover
        all bases and make them feel comfortable to continue the conversation if they
        wish.\n</think>\n\nHello! It seems like you''re saying a quick hello. How
        can I assist you today?","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"total_tokens":300,"completion_tokens":283,"estimated_cost":5.2980000000000004e-05}}'
