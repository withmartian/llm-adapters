        For the [Textual Solution Process]: \\\"To find the distance from the origin
        to the point (5, 12), we can use the distance formula derived from the Pythagorean
        theorem which is `sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)`. Here, since we are
        calculating the distance from the origin (0,0), `x_1` and `y_1` are both 0.
        Thus the formula simplifies to `sqrt(x_2^2 + y_2^2)`. Plugging in the values
        for the point (5,12), we get `sqrt(5^2 + 12^2)` which equals `sqrt(25 + 144)`
        and that simplifies to `sqrt(169)`. Since 169 is a perfect square, we can
        take the square root to get 13 as the final answer. Thus the distance from
        the origin to the point (5,12) is 13 units.\\\" Could you provide a detailed
        explanation on how you derived each step to reach the final answer, along
        with explaining why we use the distance formula and the significance of the
        Pythagorean theorem in this context?\\n\\nYes, of course! Let's break down
        the process step by step:\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Distance Formula\\nThe
        distance formula we use to calculate the distance between two points in a
        plane is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states
        that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse
        (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of
        the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:\\n\\n\\\\[ c^2
        = a^2 + b^2 \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( c \\\\) is the length of the hypotenuse,
        and \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are the lengths of the triangle's other
        two sides.\\n\\n### Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to Coordinate
        Geometry\\nIn a two-dimensional coordinate system, the distance between any
        two points can be viewed as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle where
        the two legs are the differences in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates
        of the points.\\n\\nIf we have two points \\\\( P_1(x_1, y_1) \\\\) and \\\\(
        P_2(x_2, y_2) \\\\), the horizontal side of the triangle will be \\\\( |x_2
        - x_1| \\\\) and the vertical side will be \\\\( |y_2 - y_1| \\\\). The distance
        \\\\( d \\\\) between the two points is then given by the Pythagorean theorem:\\n\\n\\\\[
        d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 \\\\]\\n\\nTaking the square root of both
        sides, we get the distance formula:\\n\\n\\\\[ d = \\\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2
        + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 3: Simplifying the Formula for the Origin\\nWhen
        one of the points is the origin, \\\\( (0,0) \\\\), the formula simplifies
        because \\\\( x_1 \\\\) and \\\\( y_1 \\\\) are both zero. This means that
        the differences \\\\( (x_2 - x_1) \\\\) and \\\\( (y_2 - y_1) \\\\) simplify
        to \\\\( x_2 \\\\) and \\\\( y_2 \\\\), respectively. So the distance formula
        simplifies to:\\n\\n\\\\[ d = \\\\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step
        4: Calculating the Distance for the Point (5,12)\\nNow, we want to find the
        distance from the origin to the point \\\\( (5,12) \\\\). Using the simplified
        distance formula, we substitute \\\\( x_2 \\\\) with 5 and \\\\( y_2 \\\\)
        with 12:\\n\\n\\\\[ d = \\\\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ d = \\\\sqrt{25
        + 144} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ d = \\\\sqrt{169} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 5: Simplifying
        to Find the Final Answer\\nSince 169 is a perfect square, we can take the
        square root without a calculator:\\n\\n\\\\[ d = \\\\sqrt{169} \\\\]\\n\\\\[
        d = 13 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, the distance from the origin to the point \\\\( (5,12)
        \\\\) is 13 units.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe significance of the Pythagorean
        theorem in this context is that it provides a way to calculate distances in
        a two-dimensional plane using coordinates. This theorem is fundamental in
        geometry and has applications in various fields, including physics, engineering,
        and computer graphics. By understanding and applying the distance formula,
        which is a direct consequence of the Pythagorean theorem, we can easily calculate
        the distance between any two points in a plane, including from the origin
        to any given point.\",\"name\":null,\"tool_calls\":null},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"logprobs\":null}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":5,\"total_tokens\":1143,\"completion_tokens\":1138,\"estimated_cost\":0.0005715000000000001}}"
