        a message with two empty quotes. Let me check the history. The previous interaction
        was a greeting exchange where the user said \"Hi\" and I responded \"Hi\".
        Now they sent \"\", which is just empty quotes.\n\nHmm, maybe they''re testing
        if the system is responsive to empty messages or unexpected inputs. Alternatively,
        it could be a mistake or accidental send. Since the user didn''t provide any
        content within the quotes, there''s no specific query to address. \n\nI need
        to respond in a friendly and helpful manner. Perhaps ask how I can assist
        them today. That way, I invite them to provide more information or clarify
        their request. It''s important to keep the conversation open and encourage
        them to ask their question or share what they need help with. Let me make
        sure my response is welcoming and not dismissive. Something like, \"Hello!
        How can I assist you today?\" should work. That acknowledges their message
