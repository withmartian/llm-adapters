        was \\\"Hi\\\", and then the next one is just empty quotes. Sometimes users
        do that when they're testing or their browser might have had an issue. I should
        check if they need help with something specific.\\n\\nI should respond politely,
        letting them know I noticed the empty message and offer help. Make sure to

        ask how I can assist them today. That should cover it.\\n</think>\\n\\nIt
