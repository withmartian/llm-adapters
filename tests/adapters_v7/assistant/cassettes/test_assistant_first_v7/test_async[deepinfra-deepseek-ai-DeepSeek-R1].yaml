        Maybe they're testing the bot or just being playful. I should acknowledge
        their repeated greeting in a friendly way. Perhaps ask how I can help them
        today again, but maybe add a smiley to keep it light. Let me make sure my
        response is welcoming and encourages them to ask their question. Don't want
        to come off as repetitive, so maybe a slight variation in the response. Yeah,
