        the user just said \\\"Hi\\\" again after I already responded with \\\"Hi\\\".
        Maybe they're testing if I'll repeat myself or if there's a different response.
        I should keep it friendly but maybe add a bit more to keep the conversation
        going. Let me think of a variation. How about adding an emoji or a question
        to engage them? But the user's previous message was just \\\"Hi\\\", so maybe
        they want a simple reply. I don't want to overdo it. Let's stick with another
        friendly greeting but slightly varied. Maybe \\\"Hello! How can I assist you
        today?\\\" That should be good.\\n</think>\\n\\nHello! How can I assist you
