        the user has sent \\\"Hi\\\" three times in a row now. Let me check the history.
        The first interaction was them saying \\\"Hi\\\", I responded with \\\"Hi\\\".
        Then they tried again with \\\"Hi\\\" again, and my second response was just
        \\\"Hi\\\" again. Now they've sent \\\"Hi\\\" a third time. \\n\\nHmm, maybe
        they're testing how I handle repeated messages or looking for a more detailed
        response. Since my previous answers were too brief, perhaps I should provide
        a more engaging reply this time. I need to acknowledge their repeated greetings
        and maybe ask how I can assist them today. That way, it encourages them to
        elaborate on what they need help with. \\n\\nI should also ensure that my
        response is friendly and open-ended to invite further conversation. Let me
        make sure not to just repeat \\\"Hi\\\" again but instead offer assistance.
        Something like, \\\"Hi again! It seems like you're saying hello a few times.
        How can I assist you today?\\\" That should work. It addresses the repetition
        and moves the conversation forward.\\n</think>\\n\\nHi again! It seems like
