        find a set of manners to issue a warning or advice on the overuse of print

        key when using print statements for debugging. Overuse can make the output
        overwhelming and hard to understand.\\\"\\n2. \\\"Be mindful of how often
        you use print statements. Too many can clutter your console and obscure important
        information.\\\"\\n3. \\\"While print statements can be helpful for debugging,
        excessive use can lead to information overload. Try to use them judiciously.\\\"\\n4.
        \\\"Consider using logging or a debugger instead of print statements for more
        organized and manageable output.\\\"\\n5. \\\"Print statements are a double-edged
        sword. They help in debugging but overuse might complicate the task. Proceed
        with caution.\\\"\\n6. \\\"Debugging with print statements is great, but try
        to limit their quantity to keep your output clean and concise.\\\"\\n7. \\\"Print
        statements can quickly become overwhelming. Try to use them strategically
        to avoid cluttered output.\\\"\\n8. \\\"To maintain a clean console, limit
        the use of print statements and consider alternatives like logging or debugging
        tools.\\\"\\n9. \\\"Remember, every print statement adds noise to the debugging
        process. Be selective in using them to maximize clarity.\\\"\\n10. \\\"While
        print statements are useful, overusing them can hinder your ability to focus
