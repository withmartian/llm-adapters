        the user sent an empty message. Let me check the history to understand the
        context.\\n\\nLooking back, the user first provided two examples of their
        conversation with me. The first example was about a customer named Xiao Li
        complaining to a store clerk about a leaking kidney lobster. The user then
        showed a revised version where I explained how to handle such a complaint
        in a service setting. Then the user sent an empty message again, and I responded
        with a system message about not understanding the input.\\n\\nNow, the user
        has a third empty message. Maybe they're testing if I can handle empty inputs
        or perhaps there's a technical issue. Since they've shown examples before,
        they might want another round of practice. Alternatively, they might be lost
        on how to proceed. Since the previous interaction was about handling customer
        complaints, maybe they need more examples or want to try another scenario.
        I should respond politely, ask for clarification, and offer assistance. Let
        me make sure to encourage them to provide details so I can help effectively.
        Avoid being too robotic, keep it friendly.\\n</think>\\n\\nHello! It looks
        like your message came through empty. Could you clarify what you're asking
        about or what you'd like help with today? Let me know, and I'll do my best
