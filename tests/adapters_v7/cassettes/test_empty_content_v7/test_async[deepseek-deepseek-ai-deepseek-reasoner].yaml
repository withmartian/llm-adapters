        the user sent three empty messages. First, I need to figure out why they're
        sending empty messages. Maybe they're testing the system, having technical
        issues, or just accidentally hit send. Since there's no content, I can't address
        a specific query. I should prompt them to provide more details so I can help
        effectively. I'll respond politely, letting them know I noticed the empty
        messages and ask how I can assist. Keeping the tone friendly and encouraging
        them to share their questions or concerns. That should cover it without making
        assumptions about their intent.\"},\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":16,\"completion_tokens\":146,\"total_tokens\":162,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":113},\"prompt_cache_hit_tokens\":0,\"prompt_cache_miss_tokens\":16},\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_5417b77867_prod0225\"}"
