        I should keep it simple but welcoming.\\n\\nHmm, maybe \\\"Hello! How can

        more warmth? \\\"Hi! How can I assist you today?\\\" Maybe that's better.
        It's a common response and open-ended, inviting them to ask for help. I should
        stay professional but approachable. I think that's good. Let me check if there's
        anything else. The user didn't specify a topic, so keeping the response general
        is best.\\n</think>\\n\\nHello! How can I assist you today? \U0001F60A\",\"name\":null,\"tool_calls\":null},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"logprobs\":null}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":11,\"total_tokens\":162,\"completion_tokens\":151,\"estimated_cost\":3.185e-05}}"
