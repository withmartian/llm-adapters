        and this is Crash Course U.S. history, and today we're going to get a little
        bit more controversial, as we move from mercantilism and the First Continental
        Congress to the American Revolution.\\n\\nMr. Green, Mr. Green, I thought
        the American Revolution was when we fought the British and won and then we
        started America and I was like, \\\"Yay, America,\\\" and now I'm like, \\\"Yay,
        America.\\\"\\n\\nWell, Me From The Past, first of all, congratulations on
        having the courage to wear jorts in public. Secondly, you're not wrong, but
        there's a lot more to it than that. The American Revolution didn't begin with
        the \\\"shot heard round the world\\\" and it didn't end with the Treaty of
        Paris in 1783. Although, fun fact: there is a Treaty of Paris. Actually, there
        are a lot of them. The Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution
        was signed in 1783, but there was also a Treaty of Paris signed in 1784, and
