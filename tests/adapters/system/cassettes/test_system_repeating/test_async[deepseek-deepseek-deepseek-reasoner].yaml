        just being playful. I should respond in a friendly way.\\n\\nFirst, I should
        acknowledge all the \\\"Hi\\\"s. Counting them, there are seven. Maybe mention
        that number to show I paid attention. Then, add something light-hearted to
        keep the conversation going. Maybe ask how they're doing or if there's something
        specific they need help with. But keep it open-ended so they can guide the
        conversation. Let me check for any hidden meaning. Seven times... Is there
        a cultural reference or something related to the number seven? Not sure. Probably
        just being repetitive for fun. Alright, craft a response that's cheerful and
        invites them to ask for help. Avoid being too robotic. Use an emoji to keep
        it friendly.
