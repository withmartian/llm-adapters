        so I saw the conversation where the user wrote \"Hi\" four times and then
        \"Hi\" three more times. I responded with \"Hi\" each time, keeping it friendly
        and open. \n\nHmm, the user might be testing how I handle multiple greetings
        or just being enthusiastic. Maybe they''re trying to see if I''ll respond
        each time or if I''ll aggregate the responses. I should keep it simple and
        consistent, showing that I''m engaged and ready to help with whatever they
        need. \n\nI wonder if they have a specific question or if they''re just saying
        hi repeatedly. I should make sure to reassure them I''m here to assist and
        maybe prompt them gently to ask anything they want. That way, the conversation
        can move forward smoothly if they have something on their mind.\n</think>\n\nHello!
        It seems like you''re saying hello multiple times. How can I assist you today?
