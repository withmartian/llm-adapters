        about the history of the United States. Of course! What would you like to
        know?Great! I'm curious about the history of the American Civil War. Can you
        tell me more about it?Certainly! The American Civil War (1861\u20131865) was
        a pivotal conflict in U.S. history, fought between the Northern states (the
        Union) and the Southern states (the Confederacy). Here\u2019s an overview:\\n\\n###
        **Causes of the War**\\n1. **Slavery**: The primary cause was the deep divide
        over slavery. The South\u2019s economy relied heavily on enslaved labor, while
        the North increasingly opposed its expansion.\\n2. **States\u2019 Rights**:
        Southern states believed in strong state sovereignty and resisted federal
        authority, particularly on issues like tariffs and slavery.\\n3. **Economic
        Differences**: The North was industrialized, while the South was agrarian,
        leading to conflicting interests.\\n4. **Political Tensions**: Disputes over
        the expansion of slavery into new territories (e.g., the Kansas-Nebraska Act,
        Dred Scott decision) heightened tensions.\\n\\n### **Key Events**\\n1. **Secession**:
        After Abraham Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860, Southern states began seceding
        from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America.\\n2. **Fort Sumter**:
        The war began in April 1861 when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in
        South Carolina.\\n3. **Major Battles**: Key battles included the First Battle
        of Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, and Vicksburg.\\n4. **Emancipation Proclamation**:
        In 1863, Lincoln declared freedom for enslaved people in Confederate states,
        shifting the war\u2019s focus to ending slavery.\\n5. **Sherman\u2019s March**:
        Union General William T. Sherman\u2019s devastating campaign through Georgia
        in 1864 crippled the South\u2019s infrastructure and morale.\\n6. **Appomattox
        Court House**: Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General
        Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865, effectively ending the war.\\n\\n### **Aftermath**\\n1.
        **Reconstruction**: The post-war period focused on rebuilding the South and
        integrating formerly enslaved people into society, though it faced significant
        resistance.\\n2. **13th Amendment**: Slavery was abolished nationwide in 1865.\\n3.
        **Legacy**: The war preserved the Union but left deep scars, including racial
        inequality and regional divisions that persist today.\\n\\nLet me know if
        you\u2019d like to dive deeper into any specific aspect!\",\n        \"tool_calls\":
