        and then \\\"Please make sure to properly format your response using Markdown
        for readability. Use headings, bullet points, and other elements as needed.\\\"\\n\\nHmm,
        maybe they're testing how I handle multiple prompts or maybe there was a formatting
        issue in previous interactions. The user wants the response properly formatted
        with Markdown. Let me check my last response. Wait, in the history, I replied
        with \\\"Hello! How can I assist you today?\\\" That was in plain text. Maybe
        they expected a formatted response even for the initial greeting.\\n\\nSo
        now, the user is emphasizing the use of Markdown. They probably want structured,
        well-formatted answers. Let me make sure to use headings, bullet points, etc.,
        as needed. Maybe they have a question but didn't specify yet. Since their
        last message was about formatting, perhaps they want an example or a demonstration
        of how I can format responses.\\n\\nAlternatively, they might have a question
        that they haven't asked yet, and the \\\"<\uFF5Cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uFF5C>\\\"
        could be a typo or an attempt to get a response. But considering the prior
        messages, it's more likely they want to see the Markdown formatting in action.
        Let me prepare a sample response that showcases different Markdown elements
        like headings, lists, bold, italics, code blocks, etc., so they can see how
        I can structure information.\\n\\nWait, but maybe they have a specific request.
        Let me prompt them again to provide their question so I can assist properly,
        but also include an example of formatted text to demonstrate compliance. That
        way, I cover both possibilities: either they need help with a specific task
        and want it formatted, or they just want to see the formatting itself.\\n<\uFF5Cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uFF5C>\\n\\nCertainly!
        Here's a formatted response to demonstrate Markdown usage. Let me know how
        I can assist you further.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Example of a Well-Formatted Response
        \ \\n**Key Features of Markdown:**  \\n- **Headings** (e.g., `### Subheading`)
        \ \\n- **Lists** (bullet points or numbered):  \\n  - Item 1  \\n  - Item
        2  \\n- **Bold** (`**text**`) and *Italics* (`*text*`)  \\n- `Inline code`
        or code blocks:  \\n  ```python  \\n  print(\\\"Hello, World!\\\")  \\n  ```
