        the user sent three empty messages in a row. Let me see what's going on here.
        The first one is just a mention of my username, \\\"</think>,\\\" followed
        by three empty messages. Hmm, maybe they started typing but didn't finish,
        or there's a technical issue.\\n\\nI should consider why they might send empty
        messages. Could be accidental, like hitting enter by mistake. Alternatively,
        they might be testing the system or trying to see how I respond to empty input.
        Since there's no content, my response needs to be open and encouraging them
        to ask a question.\\n\\nI want to be helpful without assuming their intent.
        Responding with a friendly reminder to ask a question seems appropriate. I'll
        keep it simple and positive to make sure they feel comfortable to reach out
        with their actual query.\\n</think>\\n\\nIt seems like your messages are coming
