        the user just sent \\\"continue.\\\" I need to figure out what they want me
        to continue. Let me check the conversation history.\\n\\nLooking back, the
        last message I sent was explaining how to approach solving equations step-by-step
        with examples. The user then responded with \\\"continue,\\\" so they probably
        want more information or a continuation of that explanation. \\n\\nMaybe they
        need further examples or a deeper dive into a specific part of solving equations.
        Alternatively, they might want me to cover different types of equations, like
        quadratic or systems of equations. Since my last examples were linear, perhaps
        moving to quadratics makes sense. \\n\\nI should ask for clarification to
        be sure, but if I proceed, I can expand on quadratic equations. Let me structure
        a response that continues the step-by-step approach but with quadratics. Include
        the standard form, methods like factoring, completing the square, quadratic
        formula, and an example problem. Make sure it's clear and easy to follow.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly!
        Let's continue with a step-by-step explanation of solving **quadratic equations**.
        A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial in the form:\\n\\n\\\\[
        ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\\\]  \\n*(where \\\\( a \\\\neq 0 \\\\))*\\n\\n---\\n\\n###
        **Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations**\\n1. **Factoring** (if factorable).
        \ \\n2. **Quadratic Formula**:  \\n   \\\\[ x = \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2
        - 4ac}}{2a} \\\\]  \\n3. **Completing the Square**.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Example
        1: Solving by Factoring**\\n**Equation**: \\\\( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \\\\)\\n\\n**Step
        1**: Factor the quadratic.  \\nLook for two numbers that multiply to \\\\(
        +6 \\\\) and add to \\\\( -5 \\\\).  \\n\u2192 \\\\( (-2) \\\\times (-3) =
        +6 \\\\) and \\\\( (-2) + (-3) = -5 \\\\).  \\n\\n**Step 2**: Write the factored
        form:  \\n\\\\[ (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \\\\]  \\n\\n**Step 3**: Apply the Zero
        Product Property:  \\n\\\\[ x - 2 = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad x - 3
        = 0 \\\\]  \\n\\\\[ x = 2 \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad x = 3 \\\\]  \\n\\n**Solutions**:
        \\\\( x = 2 \\\\) and \\\\( x = 3 \\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Example 2: Quadratic
        Formula**\\n**Equation**: \\\\( 2x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0 \\\\)\\n\\n**Step 1**: Identify
        \\\\( a = 2 \\\\), \\\\( b = 4 \\\\), \\\\( c = -6 \\\\).  \\n**Step 2**:
        Plug into the quadratic formula:  \\n\\\\[ x = \\\\frac{-4 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{4^2
        - 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)} \\\\]  \\n**Step 3**: Simplify under the square root:  \\n\\\\[
        \\\\sqrt{16 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 \\\\]  \\n**Step 4**: Solve:  \\n\\\\[
        x = \\\\frac{-4 \\\\pm 8}{4} \\\\]  \\n\u2192 \\\\( x = \\\\frac{4}{4} = 1
        \\\\) or \\\\( x = \\\\frac{-12}{4} = -3 \\\\).  \\n\\n**Solutions**: \\\\(
        x = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( x = -3 \\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Takeaways**\\n-
        **Discriminant** (\\\\( b^2 - 4ac \\\\)) determines the nature of roots:  \\n
        \ - \\\\( >0 \\\\): Two real solutions.  \\n  - \\\\( =0 \\\\): One real solution.
        \ \\n  - \\\\( <0 \\\\): Two complex solutions.  \\n\\nNeed more examples
