        so I need to figure out how to solve this problem: Find the number of integers
        k such that k\xB3 + 4k\xB2 + 7 is divisible by k + 3. Alright, let me start
        by understanding what's being asked here. The user wants the count of integer
        values for k where the polynomial k cubed plus 4k squared plus 7 is divisible
        by k plus 3. That means when you divide k\xB3 + 4k\xB2 + 7 by k + 3, there
        should be no remainder. \\n\\nFirst, I remember that the Remainder Theorem
        might be useful here. The theorem states that if a polynomial f(k) is divided
        by (k - a), the remainder is f(a). But in this case, the divisor is (k + 3),
        which is the same as (k - (-3)). So, according to the Remainder Theorem, the
        remainder when f(k) is divided by (k + 3) is f(-3). Therefore, if the remainder
        is zero, then k = -3 would be a root of the polynomial. But wait, in this
        problem, we need divisibility for integers k. Hmm, maybe there's a different
        approach here. Wait, actually, hold on. Let me think again.\\n\\nWait, if
        we're talking about divisibility of k\xB3 + 4k\xB2 + 7 by k + 3 for integer
        k, does that mean that k + 3 is a divisor of the value k\xB3 + 4k\xB2 + 7?
        So, for each integer k, compute k\xB3 +4k\xB2 +7, and check if k +3 divides
        that result. However, k+3 could be any integer, positive or negative, so we
        need to find k such that (k\xB3 +4k\xB2 +7) divided by (k +3) is an integer.
        \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps polynomial division here can help. If I perform
        polynomial division of k\xB3 +4k\xB2 +7 by k +3, what's the remainder? Let
        me do that. \\n\\nLet's set it up:\\n\\nDivide k\xB3 + 4k\xB2 + 0k + 7 by
        k +3. \\n\\nUsing polynomial long division:\\n\\nk + 3 )  k\xB3 + 4k\xB2 +
        0k + 7 \\n\\nFirst term: k\xB3 divided by k is k\xB2. Multiply (k +3) by k\xB2:
        k\xB3 + 3k\xB2. Subtract that from the original polynomial:\\n\\n(k\xB3 +
        4k\xB2 + 0k +7) - (k\xB3 +3k\xB2) = (0k\xB3 +1k\xB2 +0k +7).\\n\\nNext term:
        1k\xB2 divided by k is k. Multiply (k +3) by k: k\xB2 +3k. Subtract that:\\n\\n(k\xB2
        +0k +7) - (k\xB2 +3k) = (-3k +7).\\n\\nNext term: -3k divided by k is -3.
        Multiply (k +3) by -3: -3k -9. Subtract:\\n\\n(-3k +7) - (-3k -9) = 0k +16.
        So the remainder is 16.\\n\\nTherefore, the division gives k\xB3 +4k\xB2 +7
        = (k +3)(k\xB2 +k -3) +16. So for any integer k, when you divide the cubic
        by k +3, the remainder is 16. Therefore, for k +3 to divide the cubic expression,
        16 must be divisible by k +3. In other words, k +3 is a divisor of 16.\\n\\nAh!
        So, the problem reduces to finding all integers k such that k +3 divides 16.
        Because the remainder is 16, so if k +3 divides 16, then (k +3) divides the
        entire expression, as the division leaves the constant remainder 16. Therefore,
        k +3 needs to be a divisor of 16. Then, since 16 has divisors \xB11, \xB12,
        \xB14, \xB18, \xB116, these would be the possible values of (k +3). Therefore,
        solving for k, we subtract 3 from each of these divisors.\\n\\nSo the possible
        values of k are:\\n\\nFor divisor 1: 1 -3 = -2\\n\\nFor divisor -1: -1 -3
        = -4\\n\\nFor 2: 2 -3 = -1\\n\\nFor -2: -2 -3 = -5\\n\\nFor 4: 4 -3 = 1\\n\\nFor
        -4: -4 -3 = -7\\n\\nFor 8: 8 -3 =5\\n\\nFor -8: -8 -3 = -11\\n\\nFor 16: 16
        -3 =13\\n\\nFor -16: -16 -3 = -19\\n\\nTherefore, the possible k are: -19,
        -11, -7, -5, -4, -2, -1, 1, 5, 13. Let's check how many these are. Let's count
        them:\\n\\n1) -19\\n\\n2) -11\\n\\n3) -7\\n\\n4) -5\\n\\n5) -4\\n\\n6) -2\\n\\n7)
        -1\\n\\n8) 1\\n\\n9) 5\\n\\n10) 13\\n\\nSo that's 10 values. So the number
        of integers k is 10.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check my logic here. Because
        when we perform the polynomial division, we have:\\n\\nk\xB3 +4k\xB2 +7 =
        (k +3)(k\xB2 +k -3) +16\\n\\nTherefore, for the left-hand side to be divisible
        by (k +3), then the remainder term (16) must also be divisible by (k +3).
        Since (k +3) is an integer (because k is integer), then k +3 has to be a divisor
        of 16, so indeed, all divisors of 16 are \xB11, \xB12, \xB14, \xB18, \xB116.\\n\\nTherefore,
        solving k +3 = d, where d is a divisor of 16, gives k = d -3. Then, each of
        these divisors d gives a corresponding k. Since there are 10 divisors (the
        positive ones 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and the negative ones -1, -2, -4, -8, -16), that
        would yield 10 integer solutions. Therefore, yes, the answer should be 10.\\n\\nJust
        to confirm, maybe manually test a couple of these k values.\\n\\nFor example,
        take k = -2: so k +3 =1, which divides 16. Then plug into the polynomial:
        (-2)^3 +4*(-2)^2 +7 = -8 +4*4 +7 = -8 +16 +7 = 15. 15 divided by 1 is 15,
        which is an integer. Wait, but k +3 is 1, so 15 divisible by 1 is okay. But
        according to the division we did, the remainder is 16. So why is it 15 here?
        Wait, that might be a discrepancy. Wait, wait. Maybe my thought process is
        off.\\n\\nWait, no. Let's see. Let me clarify. So, the Remainder Theorem says
        that when f(k) is divided by (k +3), the remainder is f(-3). Let me compute
        f(-3):\\n\\nf(-3) = (-3)^3 +4*(-3)^2 +7 = -27 +4*(9) +7 = -27 +36 +7 = 16.
        So yes, when k is -3, the remainder is 16. But in this case, we set k as each
        possible integer value where (k +3) divides the value of the polynomial. Wait,
        the key here is confusing, perhaps. Wait. Let me retract.\\n\\nWait, maybe
        I mixed up variables here. Wait, in the problem statement, the divisors are
        k + 3, meaning that for each integer k, k +3 divides the value of f(k) where
        f(k) = k^3 +4k^2 +7. So how is that connected with the Remainder Theorem?\\n\\nBut
        note that if we consider when f(k) is divisible by (k +3), then our problem
        is to find integers k such that (k +3) divides f(k). But, however, the divisibility
        here is numerical. Let me think. For example, we can rephrase this as (k +3)
        divides f(k) when f(k) mod (k +3) =0. \\n\\nEquivalently, the equation is
        f(k) \u2261 0 mod (k + 3). So we need to solve for k where this congruence
        holds. \\n\\nAlternatively, note that f(k) divided by (k + 3) is equal to
        (k\xB2 +k -3) with a remainder of 16, as our division earlier showed. Hence,
        f(k) = (k +3)(k\xB2 +k -3) +16. Therefore, f(k) is divisible by (k +3) if
        and only if 16 is divisible by (k +3) (since the first term is already divisible
        by (k +3)). Therefore, for integers k, that is when (k +3) divides 16. So
        that's correct. \\n\\nHence, k +3 must be in the set of divisors of 16, which
        are, as listed before, \xB11, \xB12, \xB14, \xB18, \xB116, meaning k = d -3
        where d is a divisor of 16, so the solutions are indeed -19, -11, -7, -5,
        -4, -2, -1, 1,5,13, totaling 10 integers.\\n\\nBut then earlier when I took
        k = -2, f(k) was 15, but (k +3) is 1, which divides 15. That seems contradictory.
        Wait, Wait, f(k) is 15, and we are dividing by (k +3) =1. 15 divided by 1
        is 15, so the division is integer, so yes, k =-2 should be a solution. But
        according to our division, f(k) = (k +3)(k\xB2 +k -3) +16, but when (k +3)=1,
        then f(k) =1*(k\xB2 +k -3) +16. Then f(k) = k\xB2 +k -3 +16. But if (k +3)=1,
        then k= -2, and plugging k=-2 into k\xB2 +k -3 +16: (-2)^2 + (-2) -3 +16 =4
        -2 -3 +16=15, which matches. So that confirms that for k=-2, the expression
        equals 15, and (k +3)=1, so 15 divided by1 is integer. Similarly, for k=1:
        let's check. f(k) =1 +4 +7=12. (k +3)=4. 12 divided by4 is3, which is integer.
        Similarly for k=5: 125 +4*25 +7= 125 +100 +7=232. (k +3)=8. 232 divided by8
        is 29, integer. So, that works.\\n\\nNow, for k=-4. (k+3)= -1. Let's see f(k)=(-4)^3
        +4*(-4)^2 +7= -64 +4*16 +7= -64 +64 +7=7. 7 divided by -1 is -7, which is
        integer. Checks out.\\n\\nFor k=-5: k+3=-2. f(-5)=(-125) +4*(25)+7=-125+100+7=-18.
        -18/-2=9. Integer. Okay.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=-7: k+3=-4. f(-7)=(-343) +4*49
        +7= -343 +196 +7= -140. -140 divided by -4=35. Integer. Appreciated.\\n\\nFor
        k=-11: k+3=-8. Computations: f(-11)=(-1331) +4*(121) +7= -1331 +484 +7= -1331
        +491 = -840. -840 / -8 = 105. Integer. \\n\\nFor k=-19: (-19)^3 +4*(-19)^2
        +7= -6859 +4*361 +7= -6859 +1444 +7= -5408. (k +3)= -16. -5408 / -16= 338.
        Integer. \\n\\nSimilarly k=13: f(13)=2197 +4*169 +7=2197 +676 +7=2197 +683=2880.
        Check 2880 divided by 16 (since13 +3=16) is 180. Integer. \\n\\nSo all examples
        are working. So therefore, the ten values I found are indeed solutions. Thus,
        the answer is 10. \\n\\nBut just to ensure I haven't missed any divisors,
        let me list all the divisors of 16. The positive divisors are 1,2,4,8,16.
        The negative divisors are -1,-2,-4,-8,-16. Therefore, 10 divisors in total.
        Each divisor leading to a unique integer k. So, yes, the total number of integers
        k is 10. Hence, the final answer is 10.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo determine the number
        of integers \\\\( k \\\\) such that \\\\( k^3 + 4k^2 + 7 \\\\) is divisible
        by \\\\( k + 3 \\\\), we use polynomial division and properties of divisors.
        Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Polynomial Division**:  \\n   Divide
