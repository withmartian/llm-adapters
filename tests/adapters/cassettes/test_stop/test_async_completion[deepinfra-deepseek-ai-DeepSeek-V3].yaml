        Coach,\\n\\nMy children have participated in travel and recreational soccer
        since first grade. Now in 6th grade, there are additional opportunities for
        them to try-out and participate in offer sports such as lacrosse and basketball.
        Should they specialize in soccer or should they participate in these other
        sports too? How do you manage this as a coach?\\n\\nTeam Multi-Sport Parent\\n\\nDear
        Team Multi Sport Parent,\\n\\nThis is a great question and one that we get
        asked a lot in various forms. The way I manage this within my teams includes
        having conversations with the players and their parents/guardians. When discussing
        the idea of specializing in soccer early in a child\u2019s athletic career,
        I like to break the conversation into two key components.\\n\\nFirst, young
        players should play a variety of sports until high school. This exposes them
        to different coaches, styles of play, athletic movements, and challenges their
        creativity and problem-solving in different ways. When the players get closer
        to high school, and if they decide they would like to pursue playing in college,
        then that is when the critical time comes to start focusing primarily on soccer
        if that is the sport of choice.\\n\\nSecond, having a variety in the physical
        movements of players\u2019 bodies and strengthening different muscle groups
        will often prevent injury. Soccer requires a lot of one-footed movements (cleats,
        striking, passing, etc.) and more emphasis on the movement of the lower body
        and core. Other sports such as lacrosse, for example, can help develop upper
        body strength, ambidextrous coordination, spatial awareness, agility, and
        hand/eye coordination. The same can be said of other sports such as basketball,
        softball/baseball, and volleyball.\\n\\nI\u2019m glad your young players are
        considering playing multi-sports in their youth. Most importantly, remember
        to prioritize what they enjoy, have fun, and keep having these conversations
        about big decisions like whether or not to specialize in soccer.\\n\\nAll
        my best,\\n\\n\\nHave a question you\u2019d like answered in a future \u2018Hey
