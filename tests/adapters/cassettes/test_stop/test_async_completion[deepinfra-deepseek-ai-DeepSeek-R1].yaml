        am currently doing a bit of research on your comfy and I really need some
        help. I am trying to simulate the heat exchange between sunlight and a person
        in a car. I found that the incoming energy can be calculated with radiation
        and if I calculate the reflected energy and subtract that this gives the power
        from the incoming sun. So far so good.\\n\\nBut how can I calculate the body
        heat lost by a person? If I take 100 W as the heat a person produces, but
        I need to subtract the radiated, conducted, convected and evaporated energy?\\n\\nTaking
        a very simplified approach, I can take the heat generated by the person minus
        all the heat transfer. All the heat the person is losing. Then you would get
        a net heat gain. Then I can calculate how long a person could stay in that
        car for example. This is again a very simplified approach.\\n\\nBut how can
        I calculate each of the component for the heat loss? So conduction, convection,
        etc.? And how would I incorporate the environment of the car. Let's say the
        car is at 50 degrees in the sun, with the person sitting on a seat and the
        seat is conductive. For radiation inside the car, perhaps the glass directs
        radiation into the car (greenhouse effect). Convection would perhaps be dependent
        of the air speed in the car. So how can I model each of the component?\\n\\nI
        have seen the PMV model but that seems a bit too complex. Alternatively, is
        there an even more simplified approach. For example, in HowStuffWorks they
        say the incoming solar radiation is about the same as the person's heat production.
        So approx. equal. So then the person's body would have to get rid of roughly
        200 W (100 W his own) and 1000 W incoming (since a person is about 1 m\xB2
        and 1000 W/m\xB2 from the sun. So with 0.5 area facing the sun (person sitting
        in car) and perhaps 0.3 absorptance (clothes) same 150 W. Then 250 W (100
        + 150) total. But then this person would need to lose 250 W. Assuming he can
        radiante about 100 W (due to high surrounding temperatures) then 150 need
        to be lost via convection (sweat).\\n\\nBut if the air is very hot (like 50
        degrees C) then the convection is not possible (no delta T?) So in the end
        the person would heat up.\\n\\nBut how to model this step\",\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2,\"total_tokens\":514,\"completion_tokens\":512,\"estimated_cost\":0.0012817}}"
