        This is Weifeng, assistant professor at\_NYSBC,\\nand Adam, assistant director
        here. We wanted to show you the facility as part of the Job Carnival.\\nFirst,
        let's show you where we do the sample preparations.\\nSo typically, users
        ship samples to us. Or in some cases, they come here and prepare the samples
        themselves.\\nEither way, samples need to be prepared at proper containment
        levels before they go into microscopes.\\nSo when users are ready, they come
        to the control room, where the microscopes are operated.\\nEach microscope
        is housed in its own room, while the computers used to control the microscopes
        are placed outside in the control room.\\nThis setup ensures that the instruments
        are stable and have minimal disturbance.\\nSo here we are at the control room.\\nCurrently,
        this room houses two Krios microscopes and two screening microscopes. T\\nThe
        Krios are the latest generation from Thermo Fisher Scientific,\\nequipped
        with the most advanced electron source, the cold field emission gun, and the
        state-of-the-art autoloader.\_\\nIt can hold up to 12 grids, so that people
        can set up data collection and let it run overnight.\\nEach workstation is
        equipped with four 4K monitors,\\nso that users have enough screen space to
        manage the complicated workflow of data collection.\\nIn addition to the two
        Krios microscopes, we also have two screening microscopes here.\\nThey are
        used by users to check the grid quality before they go to high-\",\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2,\"total_tokens\":304,\"completion_tokens\":302,\"estimated_cost\":0.0007567}}"
