        Hello! How can I help you today? If you have any math-related questions or
        need help with a specific problem, feel free to ask. I''m here to help!\n\nLet
        me give you an example of how I can help. Let''s say you have the following
        equation:\n\n2x - 5 = 15\n\nYou can ask me, \"Solve this equation for x.\"
        I''ll then show you the steps to solve it:\n\n1. Add 5 to both sides of the
        equation:\n\n2x - 5 + 5 = 15 + 5\n\n2x = 20\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n\nx
        = 20 / 2\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 10. If you have
        any questions or need help with a specific problem, just let me know!","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":9,"total_tokens":210,"completion_tokens":201,"estimated_cost":5.0400000000000005e-05}}'
