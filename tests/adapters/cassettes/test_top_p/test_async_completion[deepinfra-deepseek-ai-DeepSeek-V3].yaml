        primes that are the largest primes less than powers of 2 is described by this
        formula. Kim\n\nHi Kermit I do not think that 31 is a counter example. 2^(30)-1
        is divisible with 31. So 2^30-1=0 mod 31 2^30=1 mod 31 2^5=1 mod 31 2^5-1=0
        mod 31 2^5-1 is divisible with 31. Kim\n\nHi Kermit I do not completely understand
        the table you made. But, as I understand it, it is the primes less than 2^n
        which are the largest primes less than 2^n. I can see that the primes\n\nHi
        Kermit The primes of the form 2^n-1 and 2^n+1 are called Mersenne primes and
        Fermat primes. The Fermat primes is exactly the primes of the form 2^n+1.
        There are only 5 known Fermat primes\n\nHi Kermit I mean that primes of the
        form 2^n-k where k is a prime for which there are no primes between k and
        2^n. So 2^n-p where p is prime and there are no primes between p and 2^n.
        Kim\n\nHello Kim. I am puzzled by your statement For primes of the form 2^n-k
        where k is a prime, this k must be a prime less than 2^(n-1) -1. It is possible
        that for some primes q that 2^n - q is\n\nHi All Here is something that I
        have found and found quite interesting. Maybe it has been proven before, but

        are not Mersenne primes. It might be interesting to prove or disprove this.
