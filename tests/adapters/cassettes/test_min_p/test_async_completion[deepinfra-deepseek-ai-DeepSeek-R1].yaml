        my name is Erica and I live in Los Angeles. I love reading, cooking, being
        outside, and learning about new people and things. This blog is a place where
        I can share my thoughts and exploits with anyone who's interested. Enjoy!\\n\\n###
        Butternut Squash Soir\xE9e\\n\\nDespite what my last entry may imply when
        you look at the date, I actually have been back from my big Europe trip for
        more than a year. Just a few days after my last post, we packed up our house
        in London and moved back to California. The time since then has had its ups
        and downs, but that's a discussion for another day.\\n\\nInstead of worrying
        about the last year's events, today I want to tell you about how, now that
        I have the time and energy for such things, I've been getting back in the
        kitchen, learning new skills and tweaking old favorites. A few people have
        mentioned that they found my recipe posts helpful, so perhaps what will follow
        is a return to recipe writing.\\n\\nNot only has hosting/entertaining come
        up in some conversations recently, but, with the possible exception of my
        busy years in law school (and even then), I love inviting friends over for
        dinner. After moving back, I had to wait a whole year before getting to host
        (!!), but when given a recent chance to prepare a meal for seven friends,
        I pounced on the opportunity. Knowing that one of the guests had a dairy allergy
        and another is vegetarian, I tried to make vegetable-centric dishes that had
        a lot of flavor so that we had options and could enjoy the entire meal. The
        day I chose to host was the first time the temperature had dropped into the
        60s here in LA (I like fall food even if LA doesn't like fall weather), so
        I thought it would be nice to do a big, hearty lunch. The menu was:\\n\\n-
        Cheese (Vermont cheddar and Saint Andr\xE9) with crackers and sliced apples\\n\\nButternut
        squash and onion galette with a spelt crust\\n\\nArugula salad with balsamic
        vinaigrette\\n\\nButter lettuce salad, citrus vinaigrette, pomegranate seeds
        and feta (on the side)\\n\\nMaple pecan tart\\n\\nEverything was (if I may
        say so myself) tasty, and even the dishes that didn't turn out exactly as
        I had hoped (looking at you, pecan tart) still provided good flavor. The surprise
        star of the meal was the butternut squash galette. While most people are\",\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2,\"total_tokens\":514,\"completion_tokens\":512,\"estimated_cost\":0.0012817}}"
