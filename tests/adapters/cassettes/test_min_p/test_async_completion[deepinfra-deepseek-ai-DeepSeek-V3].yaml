        all, I am working on a lab for my numerical methods class and I never learned
        PEMDAS in school. I was curious if the first order Taylor Series can be used
        to find an expression for the limit of a function such as (x^2 -1)/(x-1) at
        x=1? I understand how to approach the problem using algebraic techniques like
        factoring and simplification, but I am struggling to see how to use the Taylor
        Series approximation method for finding limits. Could someone please give
        me a hint on how to proceed step by step? Thank you for your help!\n\nHi there!
        It''s great that you''re exploring different methods for finding limits, especially
        in the context of your numerical methods class. While the first-order Taylor
        Series is indeed a powerful tool for approximating functions, it might not
        be the most straightforward method for evaluating limits like the one you
        provided: \\(\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}\\) as \\(x\\) approaches 1. However, I
        can guide you through how you might approach this problem using Taylor Series,
        and we can compare it to the algebraic method you''re familiar with.\n\n###
        Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let''s recall the function and the limit
        we''re interested in:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\nAt
        \\(x = 1\\), both the numerator and the denominator become zero, which results
        in an indeterminate form \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\). To evaluate this limit, we need
        to simplify or approximate the expression around \\(x = 1\\).\n\n### Step
        1: Algebraic Simplification\nThe algebraic method you''re familiar with involves
        factoring the numerator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\n\\]\n\nSo, the
        expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} = x + 1 \\quad \\text{for}
        \\quad x \\neq 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the limit is:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 1}
        (x + 1) = 2\n\\]\n\nThis is a straightforward and effective method, but your
        question is about using the Taylor Series approximation instead.\n\n### Step
        2: Introduction to Taylor Series\nThe Taylor Series allows us to approximate
        a function near a specific point \\(a\\) using its derivatives at that point.
