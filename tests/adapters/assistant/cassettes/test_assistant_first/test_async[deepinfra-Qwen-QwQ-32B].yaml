        the user said \\\"Hi\\\" and I responded with \\\"Hi!\\\" and a prompt for
        their questions or tasks. Then their next message is just two quote marks.
        Hmm, maybe they accidentally sent that? I should check if they need help with
        anything specific. Let me see... perhaps they're testing the bot's response
        to empty or nonsense inputs. I should acknowledge the empty message and re-prompt
        them. I need to keep it friendly and encouraging. Let me make sure my response
        is clear and helpful, without being pushy. Maybe add an emoji to keep it approachable.
        Alright, I'll respond with something like, \\\"Looks like you might have sent
        an empty message! How can I assist you today? Let me know if you have any
        questions or tasks you'd like help with. \U0001F60A\\\"\\n</think>\\n\\nLooks
