        the user is saying \\\"Hi\\\" again. Let me check the history. The previous
        interaction was the user greeting twice, and I responded twice. Now they're
        doing it a third time. Maybe they're testing if I'll keep responding the same
        way? Or perhaps they want to start a conversation but are unsure how to proceed.\\n\\nI
        should acknowledge their greeting warmly. Maybe add an emoji to keep it friendly.
        Let's see, \\\"Hi again! \U0001F60A How can I assist you today?\\\" That sounds
        good. It's friendly and opens the door for them to ask something. I don't
        want to just repeat \\\"Hi\\\" again since that might seem unengaged. Adding
        a question encourages them to elaborate. Alright, that should work.\\n</think>\\n\\nHi
