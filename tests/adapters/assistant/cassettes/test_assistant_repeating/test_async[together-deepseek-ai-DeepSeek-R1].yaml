        same. Now they've sent another \\\"Hi\\\". Maybe they're testing if I'll keep
        responding the same way or if there's a different response.\\n\\nI should
        consider why they're repeating the same message. It could be a test, a connection
        issue, or maybe they're just being playful. I need to respond politely but
        also try to move the conversation forward. Let me acknowledge their greeting
        and ask how I can assist them today. That way, I'm showing I'm attentive and
        ready to help, which might encourage them to state their actual request.\\n</think>\\n\\nHi!
