        the user has just sent \\\"Hi\\\" three times in a row. Each time, I responded
        with \\\"Hello! How can I assist you today?\\\" Now they sent \\\"Hi\\\" again
        for the fourth time. I need to figure out how to respond appropriately without
        being repetitive.\\n\\nHmm, they might be testing if I notice the repetition
        or checking for automated responses. Maybe they want to engage in a different
        way or start a conversation but are unsure how. I should acknowledge their
        greeting and encourage them to ask a question or share what they need help
        with. But I need to keep it friendly and open-ended.\\n\\nI don't want to
        use the exact same reply again, so maybe tweak the wording a bit. Offer assistance
        in a slightly different manner to show I'm attentive. Something like, \\\"Hello
        again! \U0001F60A How can I assist you today?\\\" Adding an emoji might make
        it feel more personable. Let them know I'm here to help with whatever they
        need, whether it's a question or just chatting. Yeah, that should work.\\n</think>\\n\\nHello
