        \", I need to solve this problem: Find all real numbers x such that x^3 -
        6x^2 + 11x - 8 = 0. Hmm, okay, so I have this cubic equation. I remember that
        for polynomials, the first step is usually to try to factor them, maybe by
        finding rational roots. Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst,
        I recall the Rational Root Theorem, which says that any possible rational
        root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term and
        q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term
        is -8 and the leading coefficient is 1. So the possible rational roots are
        the factors of -8, which are \xB11, \xB12, \xB14, \xB18. That gives me a list
        of possible roots to test.\\n\\nI can use synthetic division or direct substitution
        to test these possible roots. Let me try substituting x=1 first. Plugging
        in, I get 1 - 6 + 11 - 8. Let's calculate that: 1 - 6 is -5, plus 11 is 6,
        minus 8 is -2. So f(1) = -2, which isn't zero. So 1 isn't a root.\\n\\nNext,
        let me try x=2. Plugging in, 8 - 24 + 22 - 8. Calculating step by step: 8
        -24 is -16, plus 22 is 6, minus 8 is -2. So f(2) is also -2. Not a root either.\\n\\nHow
        about x=4? Let's see: 64 - 96 + 44 -8. 64 -96 is -32, plus 44 is 12, minus
        8 is 4. So f(4)=4, not zero.\\n\\nTrying x=8: 512 - 6*64 + 11*8 -8. Let's
        compute each term: 512, 6*64 is 384, 11*8 is 88. So 512 - 384 is 128, plus
        88 is 216, minus 8 is 208. That's way too big, so x=8 isn't a root.\\n\\nHow
        about negative numbers? Let's try x=-1: (-1)^3 is -1, -6*(-1)^2 is -6, 11*(-1)
        is -11, and -8. So adding up: -1 -6 is -7, -11 is -18, -8 is -26. Definitely
        not zero.\\n\\nx=-2: (-8) - 6*(4) + 11*(-2) -8. So -8 -24 is -32, -22 is -54,
        -8 is -62. Not zero.\\n\\nx=-4: (-64) -6*(16) +11*(-4) -8. That's -64 -96
        is -160, -44 is -204, -8 is -212. Nope.\\n\\nx=-8: That's going to be a huge
        negative number, so probably not a root.\\n\\nHmm, so none of the possible
        rational roots are actually roots. That's strange. Maybe I made a mistake
        in my calculations? Let me double-check.\\n\\nWait, when I tried x=1: 1 -6
        +11 -8. 1-6 is -5, +11 is 6, -8 is -2. Correct. x=2: 8 -24 +22 -8. 8-24 is
        -16, +22 is 6, -8 is -2. Correct. x=4: 64 -96 +44 -8. 64-96 is -32, +44 is
        12, -8 is 4. Correct. So none of these are roots. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, but the
        problem is to find all real numbers x such that the equation holds. So if
        there are no rational roots, maybe I need to factor it another way or use
        methods for solving cubics.\\n\\nI remember that for cubic equations, if it
        can't be factored easily, we can use the method of depressed cubic or Cardano's
        formula. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can factor
        by grouping or something else.\\n\\nLooking at the equation: x^3 -6x^2 +11x
        -8. Let me try grouping terms. Maybe group the first two and the last two:
        (x^3 -6x^2) + (11x -8). Factoring x^2 from the first group: x^2(x -6) + (11x
        -8). Doesn't seem helpful because the second group doesn't have a common factor
        with x-6.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe group differently: (x^3 -6x^2 +11x) -8.
        Let's see, factoring x from the first three terms: x(x^2 -6x +11) -8. Not
        helpful either.\\n\\nHmm, maybe I should try to see if it can be expressed
        as (x - a)(x^2 + bx + c). Let's attempt to factor it that way. Suppose x^3
        -6x^2 +11x -8 = (x - a)(x^2 + bx + c). Then expanding the right side: x^3
        + (b -a)x^2 + (c -ab)x -ac. Comparing coefficients:\\n\\n1. Coefficient of
        x^3: 1 on both sides, so that's fine.\\n2. Coefficient of x^2: b - a = -6\\n3.
        Coefficient of x: c - ab = 11\\n4. Constant term: -ac = -8\\n\\nSo from the
        constant term: -ac = -8 => ac = 8. So a and c are factors of 8. Since a is
        a real number, and from the possible rational roots, we saw that a could be
        1,2,4,8, but none worked. Wait, but maybe a is not rational? Hmm, but if we're
        trying to factor into a linear term and a quadratic with integer coefficients,
        then a should be a rational root, which we saw doesn't exist. So maybe this
        approach won't work.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming
        that a is an integer. But since the coefficients are integers, if it factors
        into a linear and quadratic term with integer coefficients, then a must be
        a rational root, which we saw doesn't exist. Therefore, the cubic is irreducible
        over the rationals, meaning it can't be factored into polynomials with integer
        coefficients. So I need another approach.\\n\\nI remember that for solving
        cubics, we can use Cardano's method. Let me recall the steps. First, we need
        to make a substitution to eliminate the x^2 term. The general cubic equation
        is x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0. To depress it, we substitute x = y - p/3. In our
        case, the equation is x^3 -6x^2 +11x -8 =0, so p = -6. Therefore, substituting
        x = y - (-6)/3 = y + 2.\\n\\nLet me perform this substitution. Let x = y +
        2. Then:\\n\\nx = y + 2\\n\\nx^2 = (y + 2)^2 = y^2 +4y +4\\n\\nx^3 = (y +
        2)^3 = y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8\\n\\nNow substitute into the original equation:\\n\\nx^3
        -6x^2 +11x -8 = (y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8) -6*(y^2 +4y +4) +11*(y +2) -8\\n\\nLet's
        expand each term:\\n\\nFirst term: y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8\\n\\nSecond term: -6y^2
        -24y -24\\n\\nThird term: 11y +22\\n\\nFourth term: -8\\n\\nNow combine all
        terms:\\n\\ny^3 +6y^2 +12y +8 -6y^2 -24y -24 +11y +22 -8\\n\\nLet's combine
        like terms:\\n\\ny^3: y^3\\n\\ny^2: 6y^2 -6y^2 = 0\\n\\ny: 12y -24y +11y =
        (12 -24 +11)y = (-1)y\\n\\nConstants: 8 -24 +22 -8 = (8 -8) + (-24 +22) =
        0 -2 = -2\\n\\nSo the equation becomes:\\n\\ny^3 - y -2 =0\\n\\nSo now we
        have a depressed cubic: y^3 + py + q =0, where p = -1 and q = -2.\\n\\nNow,
        according to Cardano's formula, the solution is y = u + v, where u and v satisfy
        the system:\\n\\nu^3 + v^3 = -q = 2\\n\\nand\\n\\n3uv = -p =1\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\nu^3
        + v^3 =2\\n\\nand\\n\\nuv = 1/3\\n\\nWe can let u^3 = A and v^3 = B, so A
        + B =2 and AB = (u^3)(v^3) = (uv)^3 = (1/3)^3 =1/27\\n\\nSo we have the system:\\n\\nA
        + B =2\\n\\nAB =1/27\\n\\nThis is a quadratic in terms of A and B. Let me
        write it as:\\n\\nt^2 - (A + B)t + AB =0 => t^2 -2t +1/27=0\\n\\nSolving for
