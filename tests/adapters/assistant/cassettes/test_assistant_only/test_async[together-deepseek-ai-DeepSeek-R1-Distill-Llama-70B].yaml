        \", I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says that in a
        certain population, the number of people with blood type A is 40%, type B
        is 30%, type AB is 10%, and type O is 20%. Then, it asks what the probability
        is that a randomly selected person from this population will have a blood
        type that is compatible with a person who has blood type A.\\n\\nOkay, so
        first, I need to understand what blood type compatibility means. From what
        I remember, blood type compatibility is important for blood transfusions.
        A person can receive blood from a donor if their blood type can accept the
        donor's blood type. So, for someone with blood type A, which blood types can
        they receive?\\n\\nI think blood type A has the A antigen on red blood cells.
        So, the donor's blood shouldn't have any antigens that the recipient's plasma
        will attack. People with blood type A can receive blood from type A and type
        O because type O doesn't have any A or B antigens. Wait, is that right? Or
        is it the other way around?\\n\\nLet me double-check. The ABO blood group
        system works on the principle that the recipient's plasma must not contain
        antibodies against the donor's red blood cells. So, type A blood has anti-B
        antibodies. Therefore, the donor's blood cannot have B antigens. So, type
        A can receive from type A (which has A antigens, but the recipient already
        has A, so no reaction) and type O (which has no antigens, so no reaction).
        So, yes, type A can receive from A and O.\\n\\nSo, in this population, the
        percentage of people with blood type A is 40%, and type O is 20%. Therefore,
        the probability that a randomly selected person is compatible with someone
        with type A is the sum of the probabilities of selecting someone with type
        A or type O.\\n\\nSo, that would be 40% + 20% = 60%. Therefore, the probability
        is 60%.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up donor and recipient.
        Sometimes it's easy to get confused. So, if someone is type A, they can receive
        from type A and type O. So, the compatible donors are A and O. So, in the
        population, 40% are A and 20% are O, so 60% total.\\n\\nAlternatively, if
        the question was about someone with type A donating to others, that would
        be different. Because type A can donate to type A and type AB. But in this
        case, the question is about compatibility with a person who has type A, meaning
        the person with type A is the recipient. So, the donor must be compatible
        with them.\\n\\nSo, yes, the donor needs to be type A or O. So, 40% + 20%
        = 60%.\\n\\nI think that's correct. So, the probability is 60%.\\n\\n**Final
        Answer**\\nThe probability is \\\\boxed{60\\\\%}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo determine
        the probability that a randomly selected person from the population will have
        a blood type compatible with a person who has blood type A, we need to understand
        blood type compatibility. \\n\\nA person with blood type A can receive blood
        from donors with blood type A or O. This is because blood type A has anti-B
        antibodies, so the donor's blood must not have B antigens. \\n\\nIn the given
        population:\\n- The percentage of people with blood type A is 40%.\\n- The
        percentage of people with blood type O is 20%.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability
        that a randomly selected person is compatible with someone with type A is
        the sum of the probabilities of selecting someone with type A or type O:\\n\\n\\\\[
        40\\\\% + 20\\\\% = 60\\\\% \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the probability is \\\\boxed{60\\\\%}.\",\n
