        \", I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. It says that in a
        certain population, the number of people with blood type A is 40%, type B
        is 30%, type AB is 10%, and type O is 20%. Then, it asks what the probability
        is that a randomly selected person from this population will have a blood
        type that is compatible with a person who has blood type A.\\n\\nOkay, so
        first, I need to understand what blood type compatibility means. I remember
        that blood type compatibility is important for blood transfusions. If someone
        has blood type A, they can receive blood from certain other blood types. Let
        me recall the rules.\\n\\nI think blood type compatibility is based on the
        presence or absence of antigens on red blood cells. People with type A blood
        have A antigens, type B have B antigens, type AB have both, and type O has
        neither. So, when it comes to receiving blood, a person can receive blood
        from someone who doesn't have any antigens that their own plasma will attack.\\n\\nSo,
        for someone with blood type A, their plasma has anti-B antibodies. That means
        they can receive blood from people who don't have B antigens. So, type A can
        receive from type A and type O. Because type O has no antigens, so it won't
        cause a reaction, and type A has A antigens, which their own anti-B antibodies
        won't attack.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure. So, if someone is type A, they
        can receive from type A and type O. So, in this population, the percentage
        of people with type A is 40%, and type O is 20%. So, the total compatible
        blood types would be 40% + 20% = 60%.\\n\\nIs that right? Let me think again.
        So, type A can receive from A and O. So, yes, adding those two percentages
        should give the probability that a randomly selected person is compatible.\\n\\nAlternatively,
        I can think about the donor's blood type. The donor must not have any antigens
        that the recipient's plasma will attack. Since the recipient is type A, their
        plasma has anti-B antibodies. So, the donor can't have B antigens. So, donor
        blood types must be A or O.\\n\\nTherefore, the compatible blood types are
        A and O, which are 40% and 20% respectively. So, adding them together gives
        60%.\\n\\nWait, but I also remember that sometimes AB is the universal recipient,
        but in this case, the recipient is type A, so AB can't donate to A because
        AB has both A and B antigens, which the recipient's anti-B antibodies would
        attack. So, AB is not compatible.\\n\\nSimilarly, type B has B antigens, which
        the recipient's anti-B antibodies would attack, so type B is not compatible
        either. So, only type A and O are compatible.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability
        is 40% + 20% = 60%, which is 0.6. So, 60% chance.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check.
        Maybe I'm mixing up donor and recipient compatibility. Sometimes it's the
        other way around. Let me confirm.\\n\\nIn blood transfusions, the donor's
        red blood cells must not have antigens that the recipient's plasma will attack.
        So, if the recipient is type A, their plasma has anti-B antibodies. Therefore,
        the donor's red blood cells must not have B antigens. So, donor can be type
        A (has A antigens, which are compatible because recipient has anti-B, not
        anti-A) or type O (has no antigens, so nothing to attack).\\n\\nTherefore,
        yes, type A and O are compatible. So, 40% + 20% = 60%.\\n\\nAlternatively,
        if the question was about someone with type A donating to others, that would
        be different. But in this case, it's about receiving, so the recipient is
        type A, and we're looking for compatible donors.\\n\\nSo, the answer should
        be 60%.\\n\\nWait, but let me think about the exact wording. It says, \\\"the
        probability that a randomly selected person from this population will have
        a blood type that is compatible with a person who has blood type A.\\\"\\n\\nSo,
        yes, that means the selected person is the donor, and the recipient is type
        A. So, the donor must be compatible with the recipient's blood type.\\n\\nTherefore,
        the donor must be type A or O, which are 40% + 20% = 60%.\\n\\nSo, I think
        that's correct. Therefore, the probability is 60%, or 0.6.\\n\\nBut just to
        make sure, let me think about the universal donor and universal recipient.
        Type O is the universal donor because they can donate to anyone, and AB is
        the universal recipient because they can receive from anyone. But in this
        case, the recipient is type A, so they can receive from O and A, but not from
        B or AB.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\\n\\nSo,
        the compatible blood types are A and O, which are 40% and 20%, adding up to
        60%.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability is 60%.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe probability
        that a randomly selected person from this population has a blood type compatible
        with a person who has blood type A is 60%.\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\n\\n1.
        **Understand Blood Type Compatibility:**\\n   - Blood type compatibility is
        determined by the presence of antigens on red blood cells.\\n   - A person
        with blood type A has anti-B antibodies in their plasma.\\n\\n2. **Determine
        Compatible Blood Types:**\\n   - A person with type A blood can receive blood
        from donors whose red blood cells do not have B antigens.\\n   - Therefore,
        compatible blood types are A (has A antigens) and O (has no antigens).\\n\\n3.
        **Calculate the Probability:**\\n   - The population percentages are:\\n     -
        Type A: 40%\\n     - Type O: 20%\\n   - Add the percentages of compatible
        blood types: 40% + 20% = 60%.\\n\\n**Answer:** The probability is 60%.\",\n
