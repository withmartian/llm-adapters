        this problem: A 3.0 kg block is attached to a horizontal spring that has a
        spring constant of 300 N/m. The block is pulled from its equilibrium position
        at x=0 to x=5.0 cm and released from rest. The block then oscillates in simple
        harmonic motion. Calculate the speed of the block when it is at x=3.0 cm.
        Okay, so I need to find the speed of the block when it's at 3.0 cm. Let me
        think. Hmm, simple harmonic motion, spring-block system. I remember that energy
        conservation is involved here. The total mechanical energy in the system should
        be the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At the maximum displacement, all
        energy is potential, and at equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic. So
        maybe I can use the conservation of energy to find the speed at 3.0 cm.\\n\\nFirst,
        let me recall the formulas. The potential energy stored in a spring is (1/2)kx\xB2,
        right? And the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\xB2. So the total energy should be
        the sum of these two, and since energy is conserved, the total energy at any
        point should be equal to the total energy at the maximum displacement, where
        kinetic energy is zero. So, total energy E = (1/2)kA\xB2, where A is the amplitude,
        which is 5.0 cm here. Then, at position x=3.0 cm, the potential energy is
        (1/2)k(0.03 m)\xB2 and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\xB2. So, setting them
        equal: (1/2)kA\xB2 = (1/2)kx\xB2 + (1/2)mv\xB2. Then I can solve for v.\\n\\nLet
        me write that equation out:\\n\\n(1/2)kA\xB2 = (1/2)kx\xB2 + (1/2)mv\xB2\\n\\nMultiply
        both sides by 2 to eliminate the 1/2:\\n\\nkA\xB2 = kx\xB2 + mv\xB2\\n\\nThen,
        subtract kx\xB2 from both sides:\\n\\nkA\xB2 - kx\xB2 = mv\xB2\\n\\nFactor
        out k:\\n\\nk(A\xB2 - x\xB2) = mv\xB2\\n\\nThen solve for v:\\n\\nv = sqrt(
        [k(A\xB2 - x\xB2)] / m )\\n\\nOkay, that seems right. Let me plug in the numbers.
        But first, make sure all units are in meters and kilograms. The amplitude
        A is 5.0 cm, which is 0.05 m. The position x is 3.0 cm, which is 0.03 m. The
        spring constant k is 300 N/m, and mass m is 3.0 kg.\\n\\nSo plugging in:\\n\\nv
        = sqrt( [300*(0.05\xB2 - 0.03\xB2)] / 3.0 )\\n\\nFirst compute 0.05\xB2: 0.0025\\n\\n0.03\xB2:
        0.0009\\n\\nSubtract: 0.0025 - 0.0009 = 0.0016\\n\\nMultiply by 300: 300 *
        0.0016 = 0.48\\n\\nDivide by 3.0: 0.48 / 3.0 = 0.16\\n\\nThen take the square
        root: sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 m/s\\n\\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the speed
        is 0.4 m/s. Let me check if that makes sense. At x=0, the speed should be
        maximum. Let's compute the maximum speed to see if 0.4 is reasonable.\\n\\nMaximum
        speed v_max = A*sqrt(k/m) = 0.05*sqrt(300/3) = 0.05*sqrt(100) = 0.05*10 =
        0.5 m/s. So the maximum speed is 0.5 m/s. Then at x=3 cm, the speed is 0.4
        m/s, which is less than maximum. That seems reasonable. Because 3 cm is closer
        to the equilibrium than 5 cm, so the speed should be increasing as it approaches
        equilibrium. So 0.4 m/s at 3 cm is plausible.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I
        can check using another method. For example, using the equation for velocity
        in SHM: v = \xB1\u03C9\u221A(A\xB2 - x\xB2), where \u03C9 is the angular frequency.
        Let's compute \u03C9 first. \u03C9 = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(300/3) = sqrt(100) =
        10 rad/s. Then, v = 10*sqrt(0.05\xB2 - 0.03\xB2) = 10*sqrt(0.0025 - 0.0009)
        = 10*sqrt(0.0016) = 10*0.04 = 0.4 m/s. Same result. So that confirms it.\\n\\nTherefore,
        the speed at x=3.0 cm is 0.4 m/s.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe speed of the
        block when it is at x=3.0 cm is \\\\boxed{0.4 \\\\text{ m/s}}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo
        find the speed of the block when it is at \\\\( x = 3.0 \\\\, \\\\text{cm}
        \\\\), we use the conservation of energy principle. The total mechanical energy
        in the system is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At maximum displacement,
        all energy is potential, and at equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic.
        \\n\\nThe total energy \\\\( E \\\\) is given by:\\n\\\\[ E = \\\\frac{1}{2}
        k A^2 \\\\]\\nwhere \\\\( A \\\\) is the amplitude (0.05 m), \\\\( k \\\\)
        is the spring constant (300 N/m), and \\\\( m \\\\) is the mass (3.0 kg).\\n\\nAt
        position \\\\( x = 0.03 \\\\, \\\\text{m} \\\\), the potential energy is \\\\(
        \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) and the kinetic energy is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2}
        m v^2 \\\\). Setting the total energy equal at both points:\\n\\\\[ \\\\frac{1}{2}
        k A^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\\\]\\n\\nMultiplying
        through by 2:\\n\\\\[ k A^2 = k x^2 + m v^2 \\\\]\\n\\nRearranging and solving
        for \\\\( v \\\\):\\n\\\\[ v = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{k (A^2 - x^2)}{m} } \\\\]\\n\\nPlugging

        v = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{300 \\\\times 0.0016}{3.0} } \\\\]\\n\\\\[ v = \\\\sqrt{
