        all.\\n\\nBeen reading threads on here for some time. Decided to register
        and ask for some help if possible.\\n\\nMy wife has a 56 plate Corsa 1.3CDTI
        75bhp with around 125k miles. Been having a few issues with it and have taken
        it to a local garage to be looked at.\\n\\nBasically the issues were with
        a lack of power, excessive smoke and hesitation.\\n\\nI suspected the EGR
        valve was blocked or faulty, so I did the pedal test to see if there were
        any codes. It came up with ECN227956. On reading up on the code, it says it
        relates to Intake air leak, but I could find any mention of the 56 on the
        end.\\n\\nAnyway, the garage have had a look at it and said the swirl flaps
        are worn and need replacing. They are saying the whole inlet manifold needs
        changing and have quoted \xA3550 plus VAT.\\n\\nI have read conflicting opinions
        on weather it is better to blank/delete them or replace them. I have seen
        blanking plates available for around \xA320, but I am unsure what is best
        and what exactly would be involved.\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated.\\n\\nMany
        thanks.\\nI have a similar issue with my 1.3.\\nI have been advised to replace
        the manifold or the swirl flaps could break and destroy the engine.\\nI got
        the manifold with swirl flaps fitted for \xA3130 and have it in the garage
        ready to fit.\\nI haven't looked at the procedure yet but I understand it's
        a manifold off job so you may as well replace it.\\nI'm not sure about the
        blanking plates.\\nSomeone else may be able to advise on that.\\nThanks for
        the reply.\\n\\n\xA3130 seems a much better price than what I have been quoted.\\n\\nWhere
        did you get the manifold from?\\nI will have to check but I think it was from
        ebay.\\nThere were a few on there but I got one from a breakers yard that
        guaranteed it was fully working.\\nJust had a look and it was from ebay breakers
        yard.\\nI have the link if you are interested but not sure if I can post it
        on here.\\nI blanked mine on my 54 plate 1.3cdti with 85k on the clock for
        \xA320. Easy job once you've got to it. No problems at all. But don't know
        how long it will last.\\nThanks for the replies.\\n\\nI would be interested
        in the link if you can post it.\\n\\nThe car is only used for short trips
        now as my wife works close to home.\\n\\nI would probably prefer to blank
        them, but would like to know exactly what to do, as I have never done it before.\\n\\nWould
        the ECN code I got previously be a result of the worn swirl flaps?\\nI have
        found the link.\\nPM sent.\\nYes the error code could be related to the swirl
        flaps.\\nThanks, just sent you a PM.\\nSorry to butt in on this thread, but
        i am also having similar problems.\\n\\nMy Corsa is a 1.3 CDTI 75 bhp 58 plate.
        120k miles.\\n\\nI am getting error code p227956, i have been doing some research
        and i believe the inlet manifold has a leak.\\nHas anyone had any luck just
        replacing the gaskets to the inlet manifold? I have found a set for around
        \xA313.\\n\\nAlso, i have noticed that when i am driving along, sometimes
        the car will momentarily lose power and then carry on as normal. (Like when
        you are coasting, but i am on the accelerator) I was also wondering if this
        could be linked to the EGR? I have seen that the EGR is easily blanked, so
        i am thinking of trying this first.\\nAlso, there is a bit of oil around where
        the inlet manifold meets the engine block, is this normal or is this another
        indicator that the inlet manifold is failing?\\n\\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\\nThe
        oil could be a sign of the manifold failing.\\nI'm not sure on the EGR as
        I haven't done mine yet.\\nI blanked my egr off because of similar problems.
        It was easy enough to do and seemed to help.\\nThe oil is caused by the crankcase
        breather which is vented into the intake pipe on the turbo. The oil gets into
        the manifold causing the swirl flaps to gunk up and go sticky which wears
        the bushes and allows air to escape. A lot of the codes are caused by a loss
        of vacuum in the system.\\nThanks for all the replies.\\n\\nThe manifold I
        got was from VAUXHALL SPARES BREAKERS on ebay. \xA3130 delivered and fully
        working. They have a few more for sale.\\n\\nI am going to try blanking the
        EGR valve first, just to rule it out.\\n\\nThen I think I will go ahead and
        change the manifold.\\n\\nWill let you know how I get on.\\nThanks again.\\nGood
        luck with the repair.\\nPlease keep us updated with your progress.\\nI'm keen
        to find out if the new manifold sorts out your problems.\\nHi all.\\n\\nI
        managed to get the new manifold fitted on Saturday. It wasn't too difficult,
        but a bit fiddly in places. Probably took around 3 hours.\\n\\nThe old manifold
        was quite oily and the swirl flaps were very stiff.\\n\\nI have only done
        a few short journeys in it since, but it does seem better. The fault code
        has cleared and not returned.\\n\\nIt may just be my imagination, but it does
        seem to be slightly down on power compared to what it was. Not too bad, but
        I think it could be better.\\n\\nI am going to look at blanking the EGR valve
        next. Do you know what size blanking plate to get and where is the best place
        to fit it.\\n\\nThanks again.\\nThat's good news.\\nPleased to hear the new
        manifold has made an improvement.\\nI got mine from ebay. Just search 1.3
        cdti egr blanking plate. Think I paid around \xA35.\\nI fitted it where the
        egr pipe joins the inlet manifold.\\nI had the same slight loss of power when
        I blanked mine, I think that is normal. I have heard a remap sorts it out,
        or a bleed valve in the blanking plate. Not tried either yet.\\nThanks for
        the replies.\\n\\nI'll get the blanking plate ordered and fit it as soon as
        I can.\\nKeep us updated.\",\"role\":\"assistant\"}}],\"created\":1740771502,\"model\":\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":1383,\"prompt_tokens\":1,\"total_tokens\":1384}}"
