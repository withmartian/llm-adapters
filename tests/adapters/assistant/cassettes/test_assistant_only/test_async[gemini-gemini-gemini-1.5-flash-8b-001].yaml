        am trying to generate a report that shows a percentage change in the number
        of tickets assigned to different departments for a given date range.\n\nI''t
        needs to show columns like:\n\n* Department Name\n* Total Tickets Assigned
        in the date range for the department.\n* Percentage Change from Previous Period
        (e.g., previous month)\n\nI''m using SQL Server.\n\n```sql\n-- Sample Table
        Structure\nCREATE TABLE Tickets\n(\n    TicketID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    DepartmentName
        VARCHAR(50),\n    AssignmentDate DATE\n);\n\n-- Sample Data\nINSERT INTO Tickets
        (TicketID, DepartmentName, AssignmentDate) VALUES\n(1, ''Sales'', ''2023-10-26''),\n(2,
        ''Marketing'', ''2023-10-27''),\n(3, ''Sales'', ''2023-10-27''),\n(4, ''Sales'',
        ''2023-11-01''),\n(5, ''Marketing'', ''2023-11-01''),\n(6, ''Sales'', ''2023-11-15''),\n(7,
        ''Support'', ''2023-10-28''),\n(8, ''Sales'', ''2023-11-05'');\n\n-- Calculate
        the total tickets assigned to each department in the current period\nSELECT\n\tDepartmentName,\n    COUNT(*)
        AS CurrentPeriodTickets\nFROM Tickets\nWHERE AssignmentDate BETWEEN ''2023-10-26''
        AND ''2023-11-15''\nGROUP BY DepartmentName;\n\n```\n\nTo get the previous
        period''s data, I''d need to define the start and end dates of the previous
        month.\n\n\n```sql\n-- Calculate the total tickets assigned to each department
        in the previous period\nDECLARE @PreviousPeriodStartDate DATE, @PreviousPeriodEndDate
        DATE;\n\nSELECT\n    @PreviousPeriodStartDate = DATEADD(month,DATEDIFF(month,0,GETDATE())-1,0),\n    @PreviousPeriodEndDate
        = DATEADD(day,-1,DATEADD(month,DATEDIFF(month,0,GETDATE()),0))\n\nSELECT\n\tDepartmentName,\n    COUNT(*)
        AS PreviousPeriodTickets\nFROM Tickets\nWHERE AssignmentDate BETWEEN @PreviousPeriodStartDate
        AND @PreviousPeriodEndDate\nGROUP BY DepartmentName;\n```\n\nI need to combine
        these queries to get the percentage change.\n\n\n```sql\n-- Final Query (Needs
        improvement)\n\nSELECT\n\tt1.DepartmentName,\n\tt1.CurrentPeriodTickets,\n\t(CAST(t1.CurrentPeriodTickets
        AS DECIMAL(18, 2)) / CAST(t1.PreviousPeriodTickets AS DECIMAL(18, 2))) * 100
        AS PercentageChange\nFROM (\n\tSELECT\n\t\tDepartmentName,\n\t\tCOUNT(*) AS
        CurrentPeriodTickets\n\tFROM Tickets\n\tWHERE AssignmentDate BETWEEN ''2023-10-26''
        AND ''2023-11-15''\n\tGROUP BY DepartmentName\n) AS t1\nJOIN (\n\tSELECT\n\t\tDepartmentName,\n\t\tCOUNT(*)
        AS PreviousPeriodTickets\n\tFROM Tickets\n\tWHERE AssignmentDate BETWEEN DATEADD(month,DATEDIFF(month,0,GETDATE())-1,0)
        AND DATEADD(day,-1,DATEADD(month,DATEDIFF(month,0,GETDATE()),0))\n\tGROUP
        BY DepartmentName\n) AS t2 ON t1.DepartmentName = t2.DepartmentName;\n```\n\n**Complete
        and Improved Solution:**\n\n```sql\n-- Calculate the percentage change in
        tickets assigned to each department.\nDECLARE @CurrentPeriodStartDate DATE
        = ''2023-10-26'', @CurrentPeriodEndDate DATE = ''2023-11-15'';\nDECLARE @PreviousPeriodStartDate
        DATE, @PreviousPeriodEndDate DATE;\n\nSELECT\n    @PreviousPeriodStartDate
        = DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 1, @CurrentPeriodStartDate), 0),\n    @PreviousPeriodEndDate
        = DATEADD(day, -1, DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, @CurrentPeriodStartDate),
        0));\n\n\nSELECT\n    d.DepartmentName,\n    CurrentPeriodTickets,\n    ISNULL(PreviousPeriodTickets,
        0) AS PreviousPeriodTickets,\n    CASE\n        WHEN ISNULL(PreviousPeriodTickets,
        0) = 0\n        THEN 0.00\n        ELSE\n            ROUND((CAST(CurrentPeriodTickets
        AS DECIMAL(18, 2)) / CAST(PreviousPeriodTickets AS DECIMAL(18, 2))) * 100
        - 100, 2)\n    END AS PercentageChange\nFROM\n(\n    SELECT\n        DepartmentName,\n        COUNT(*)
        AS CurrentPeriodTickets\n    FROM Tickets\n    WHERE AssignmentDate BETWEEN
        @CurrentPeriodStartDate AND @CurrentPeriodEndDate\n    GROUP BY DepartmentName\n)
        AS d\nLEFT JOIN\n(\n    SELECT\n        DepartmentName,\n        COUNT(*)
        AS PreviousPeriodTickets\n    FROM Tickets\n    WHERE AssignmentDate BETWEEN
        @PreviousPeriodStartDate AND @PreviousPeriodEndDate\n    GROUP BY DepartmentName\n)
        AS p ON d.DepartmentName = p.DepartmentName;\n```\n\n**Explanation and Improvements:**\n\n*
        **Clearer Variable Declarations:**  Defines `@CurrentPeriodStartDate` and
        `@CurrentPeriodEndDate` for better readability and maintainability.  Crucially,
        the previous period''s dates are calculated using these variables, instead
        of relying on `GETDATE()`, which could lead to incorrect results if the query
        runs on different dates.\n* **LEFT JOIN:** Uses `LEFT JOIN` to handle cases
        where a department might not have tickets in the previous period. This prevents
        errors from division by zero and returns 0% for those cases.\n* **ISNULL:**
        Explicitly handles the `NULL` values that `LEFT JOIN` might produce using
        `ISNULL` for `PreviousPeriodTickets`.\n* **Accurate Percentage Calculation:**
        Calculates the percentage change correctly by subtracting 100 from the result
        of the division.  This accurately represents the percentage *increase* or
        *decrease*.\n* **ROUNDing:**  Rounds the `PercentageChange` to two decimal
        places using `ROUND()`.\n\n\nThis revised solution is more robust and handles
        potential issues more gracefully. Remember to replace `''2023-10-26''` and
        `''2023-11-15''` with your actual date range.  Using parameterized dates is
        a best practice for maintainability.\n\n\n```sql\n--Example usage with parameterized
        dates\nDECLARE @CurrentPeriodStartDate DATE = ''20231026'', @CurrentPeriodEndDate
        DATE = ''20231115'';\n```","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1740771440,"model":"gemini-1.5-flash-8b-001","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":1461,"prompt_tokens":1,"total_tokens":1462}}'
