        I need to solve this problem:\\nIn a shopping mall, there are 3 security guards
        each with specific roles:\\n1. Supervisor (1)\\n2. Patrol officer (2)\\n3.
        Security Analyst (3)\\nEach of them has a schedule of working hours. The supervisor
        works from 9 AM to 5 PM, the patrol officer works from 9 AM to 9 PM, and the
        security analyst works from 9 AM to 1 PM. I need to determine the total number
        of hours each guard is available to work with overlap considerations.\\n\\nOkay,
        first, let me understand the problem. There are three security guards with
        different shifts. I need to figure out how many hours each one is working,
        considering any overlaps. Wait, but all of them start at 9 AM? So from 9 AM
        to their respective end times.\\n\\nSo the Supervisor is from 9 AM to 5 PM.
        Let's calculate that first. From 9 to 5 is 8 hours. Wait, 5 PM minus 9 AM
        is 8 hours because 9 to 12 is 3 hours, and 12 to 5 is 5 hours, so total 8.
        So Supervisor works 8 hours.\\n\\nNext, the Patrol officer is from 9 AM to
        9 PM. So that's a longer shift. From 9 AM to 9 PM is 12 hours. Because from
        9 AM to 12 PM is 3 hours, 12 PM to 9 PM is 9 hours, so total 12. So Patrol
        officer works 12 hours.\\n\\nSecurity Analyst is from 9 AM to 1 PM. That seems
        shorter. From 9 to 1 PM is 4 hours, right? 9, 10, 11, 12, 1. Wait, but that's
        four hours, but the time difference is 1 - 9 = 4 hours... Hmm, wait, no, 1
        PM is 13:00, 9 AM is 9:00. So 13 minus 9 is 4 hours. So Security Analyst works
        4 hours.\\n\\nNow, the overlap considerations. But since each has different
        roles, does that affect the total hours? I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe the
        question isn't about overlapping shifts, perhaps it's just about calculating
        the total hours each one is available, not considering overlaps. Because each
        has their own role, they\u2019re on duty regardless of others. So maybe I
        don't need to worry about overlaps for each person's total hours.\\n\\nWait,
        but the problem says \\\"with overlap considerations.\\\" So perhaps I'm being
        asked how many hours each is available when considering if their shifts overlap
        with others. Or maybe it's about the total coverage across all guards considering
        overlaps. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.\\n\\nWait, let me think. Maybe
        it's about the total number of hours each is available, taking into account
        if they're overlapping or not. But since each has their own fixed schedule,
        maybe the overlaps don't really affect each individual's total hours because
        they're different roles. So maybe it's just straightforward calculation of
        each person's shift duration.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking
        for the total numbers of coverage with overlaps, perhaps it's about the combined
        coverage. But the question says \\\"the total number of hours each guard is
        available to work with overlap considerations.\\\" So maybe it's each guard's
        individual hours, and whether their shift overlaps with others. Wait, maybe
        that's not it.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the user meant that the mall operates from
        9 AM to 9 PM. The supervisor is 9-5, which is within that. Patrol is 9-9,
        which is the full time. Security analyst is 9-1, which is part of it. But
        how does that affect each guard's total available hours? Maybe that's not
        necessary.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the question is just to compute each guard's
        total working hours as per their shifts, which are already fixed. So regardless
        of others' shifts, each works their own hours.\\n\\nSo, in summary:\\n\\n-
        Supervisor: 9 AM to 5 PM is 8 hours.\\n- Patrol officer: 9 AM to 9 PM is 12
        hours.\\n- Security Analyst: 9 AM to 1 PM is 4 hours.\\n\\nTherefore, the
        total hours each is available are 8, 12, and 4 hours, respectively.\\n\\nI
        think that's the answer. Maybe 'with overlap considerations' was a red herring,
        because each guard's role is different, and they don't interfere with each
        other's hours.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe total number of hours each security
        guard is available is as follows:\\n- Supervisor: \\\\boxed{8} hours\\n- Patrol
        officer: \\\\boxed{12} hours\\n- Security Analyst: \\\\boxed{4} hours\\n</think>\\n\\nTo
        determine the total number of hours each security guard is available to work,
        we simply calculate the duration of each guard's shift.\\n\\n1. **Supervisor**:
        Works from 9 AM to 5 PM.\\n   - From 9 AM to 12 PM is 3 hours.\\n   - From
        12 PM to 5 PM is 5 hours.\\n   - Total: \\\\(3 + 5 = 8\\\\) hours.\\n\\n2.
        **Patrol officer**: Works from 9 AM to 9 PM.\\n   - From 9 AM to 12 PM is
        3 hours.\\n   - From 12 PM to 9 PM is 9 hours.\\n   - Total: \\\\(3 + 9 =
        12\\\\) hours.\\n\\n3. **Security Analyst**: Works from 9 AM to 1 PM.\\n   -
        This duration is 4 hours.\\n\\nThus, the total number of hours each security
        guard is available is:\\n\\n- Supervisor: \\\\(\\\\boxed{8}\\\\) hours\\n-
        Patrol officer: \\\\(\\\\boxed{12}\\\\) hours\\n- Security Analyst: \\\\(\\\\boxed{4}\\\\)
