        I can provide information on whether an older child or adult can develop ADHD
        or if they could have had it since childhood without a diagnosis.\n\n**Can
        an Older Child or Adult Develop ADHD?**\nADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
        Disorder) is generally considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, meaning it
        typically arises during childhood. While ADHD is usually diagnosed in early
        childhood, it is possible for symptoms to become more noticeable or problematic
        later in life, especially in environments that require sustained attention
        or organization (e.g., higher education or a demanding job).\n\nHowever, **ADHD
        does not develop for the first time in adulthood**. If someone is diagnosed
        with ADHD as an adult, it is likely that they had the condition since childhood
        but it went undiagnosed or was mild enough to not cause significant impairment.\n\n**Could
        They Have Had It Since Childhood Without a Diagnosis?**\nYes, it is very common
        for ADHD to go undiagnosed in childhood, especially in individuals with predominantly
        inattentive symptoms (as opposed to hyperactive or impulsive symptoms). This
        often happens because:\n\n1. **Subtle Symptoms**: Inattentive symptoms may
        be less disruptive and therefore less likely to be noticed by parents or teachers.\n2.
        **Compensatory Strategies**: Some individuals develop coping mechanisms that
        mask their symptoms, such as relying on intelligence, structure, or external
        support.\n3. **Misdiagnosis**: ADHD symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions,
        such as anxiety, depression, or learning disabilities.\n4. **Cultural or Environmental
        Factors**: In some cases, family or societal expectations may downplay or
        overlook ADHD symptoms.\n\nIn adulthood, life demands often increase, and
        previously effective coping strategies may no longer be sufficient, leading
        to a diagnosis later in life.\n\n**How Is ADHD Diagnosed in Adults?**\nDiagnosis
        in adults typically involves:\n- A comprehensive clinical interview to assess
        symptoms and their history.\n- Retrospective reporting of childhood behaviors
        (e.g., school reports, parental input).\n- Screening for other conditions
        that may mimic ADHD (e.g., anxiety, depression, sleep disorders).\n\nIf you
        suspect that you or someone you know may have undiagnosed ADHD, consulting
        a mental health professional or clinician experienced in ADHD is the best
        course of action.","name":null,"tool_calls":[]},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":5,"total_tokens":457,"completion_tokens":452,"estimated_cost":0.00041105000000000004}}'
