        the user just sent two double quotes. Hmm, that's pretty vague. Maybe they're
        testing if I'm paying attention or just being playful. Let me think. They
        started with \\\"Hi\\\" and then followed with the quotes. The quotes could
        be an attempt to input something but maybe they left it empty. I should respond
        in a friendly way, encouraging them to ask something or let them know I'm
        here to help. I don't want to assume too much, so I'll keep it open-ended.
        Something like \\\"How can I assist you today?\\\" should work. It's simple
        and invites them to specify their needs. I'll make sure the tone stays welcoming
        and helpful.\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nIt looks like your message might be incomplete
