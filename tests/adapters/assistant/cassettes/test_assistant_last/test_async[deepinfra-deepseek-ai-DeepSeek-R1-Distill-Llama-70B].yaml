        the user wrote \"Hi 2/\". That''s an unusual greeting. Maybe they meant \"Hi,
        2!\" or \"Hi 2/\" as a typo. I''ll ask them to clarify what they mean by \"2/\".
        It could be they''re referring to a fraction or something else. I''ll keep
        it open-ended so they can explain.\n\nCertainly! Could you clarify what you
        mean by \"2/\"? Are you referring to a fraction, a date, or something else?
        Let me know how I can help!","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":6,"total_tokens":117,"completion_tokens":111,"estimated_cost":7.797e-05}}'
