      string: "{\"outputs\":[{\"text\":\". I'm new to the subreddit and I was wondering
        if anyone had any advice for getting a new tank setup. I'm planning on getting
        a 55 gallon tank and I've been researching for a while, but I'd like to hear
        some firsthand advice from experienced hobbyists.\\n\\nExperienced Hobbyist:
        Hello and welcome to the subreddit! I'm glad to see that you're doing your
        research before setting up your new tank. Here are some tips that might be
        helpful:\\n\\n1. Plan out your tank layout before you start setting it up.
        Consider what types of fish you want to keep and what their specific requirements
        are (e.g. temperature, water parameters, tankmates, etc.). Make a sketch or
        use a tank planner app to help you visualize the layout.\\n2. Choose a good
        quality filter that can handle the bioload of your planned stocking. A hang-on-back
        filter or canister filter are good options for a 55 gallon tank.\\n3. Set
        up your heater and thermometer to maintain the correct temperature for your
        fish. Most tropical fish prefer a temperature between 72-80\xB0F (22-27\xB0C).\\n4.
        Add a substrate to the bottom of the tank. Sand is a good choice for many
        fish species, but gravel or crushed coral can also be used.\\n5. Decorate
        the tank with rocks, driftwood, and plants to create hiding places and visual
        interest. Be sure to rinse any decorations thoroughly before adding them to
        the tank.\\n6. Install your filter, heater, and other equipment according
        to the manufacturer's instructions.\\n7. Add water to the tank and cycle it
        before adding any fish. This will help establish a healthy bacterial colony
        that will break down waste and keep the water clean.\\n8. Acclimate your fish
        to the new tank by floating their bag in the water for 15-30 minutes before
        gently netting them out and adding them to the tank.\\n9. Monitor the water
        parameters closely after adding new fish and make adjustments as needed. Test
        the water regularly for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH levels.\\n10. Feed
        your fish a balanced diet of high-quality fish food and avoid overfeeding.\\n\\nI
        hope these tips are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
        Good luck with your new tank setup!\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop\"}]}"
