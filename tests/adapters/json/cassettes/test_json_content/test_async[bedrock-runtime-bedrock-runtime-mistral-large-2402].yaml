      string: "{\"outputs\":[{\"text\":\", I'm interested in learning more about the
        history of the Great Wall of China. Can you provide some information on its
        construction and purpose?\\n\\nAssistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you
        learn more about the Great Wall of China. The Great Wall is a series of fortifications
        made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built
        along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China
        to protect the Chinese states and empires against raids and invasions from
        various nomadic groups.\\n\\nThe construction of the Great Wall began as early
        as the 7th century BC under different Chinese states. However, the most well-known
        sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). The wall stretches
        for about 21,196 kilometers, making it the longest wall in the world.\\n\\nThe
        purpose of the Great Wall was primarily military, serving as a defense line
        against invasions, particularly from the Mongols to the north. It also functioned
        as a transportation corridor, helping to move goods across the country and
        facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Additionally, it served as a means
        of border control, allowing the Chinese to regulate immigration and emigration.\\n\\nWould
        you like more information on a specific aspect of the Great Wall, such as
        its architecture or its impact on Chinese culture?\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop\"}]}"
