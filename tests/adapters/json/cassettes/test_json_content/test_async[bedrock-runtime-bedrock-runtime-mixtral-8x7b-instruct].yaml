      string: '{"outputs":[{"text":"! I''m a bit confused about the difference between
        a 1:1 ratio and 100% ratio. Can you help me understand?\nAssistant: Hello!
        Of course, I''d be happy to help clarify the difference between a 1:1 ratio
        and a 100% ratio.\n\nA 1:1 ratio means that for every unit of one thing, there
        is an equal unit of another thing. For example, if you mix one cup of sugar
        with one cup of flour, you have a 1:1 ratio.\n\nA 100% ratio, on the other
        hand, is often used in the context of percentages. It means that something
        is being compared to the total. For example, if you have a solution that is
        100% salt, it means that all of the solution is salt. If you dilute it to
        50%, it means that half of the solution is salt and the other half is something
        else, usually water.\n\nSo, while both ratios are used to express relationships
        between quantities, they are used in slightly different contexts. I hope this
        helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","stop_reason":"stop"}]}'
