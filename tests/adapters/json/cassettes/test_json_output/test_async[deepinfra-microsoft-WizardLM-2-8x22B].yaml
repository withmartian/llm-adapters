        JSON object represents a person with some basic information such as name,
        age, and whether they are a student. It also includes an address object with
        street, city, and zip code, as well as an array of phone numbers, each with
        a type and number. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy
        for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":276,"completion_tokens":264,"estimated_cost":0.000138}}'
