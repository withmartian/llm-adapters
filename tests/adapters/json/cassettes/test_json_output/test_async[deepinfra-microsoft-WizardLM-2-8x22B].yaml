        Certainly! Below is an example of a simple JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
        structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Doe\",\n  \"age\":
        30,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\":
        \"New York\",\n    \"state\": \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\":
        [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"212-555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\":
        \"office\",\n      \"number\": \"646-555-4567\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\":
        [],\n  \"spouse\": null\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object includes:\n- A person''s
        `firstName` and `lastName`.\n- Their `age`.\n- An `address` object that contains
        further details such as `streetAddress`, `city`, `state`, and `postalCode`.\n-
        An array of `phoneNumbers`, each with a `type` and `number`.\n- An empty `children`
        array, which implies the person has no children.\n- A `spouse` value set to
        `null`, indicating they have no spouse.\n\nJSON is a lightweight data-interchange
        format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to
        parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming
        Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":399,"completion_tokens":387,"estimated_cost":0.00019950000000000002}}'
